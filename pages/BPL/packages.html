                            The teacher meets with their coach 12 times over the course of the year as well as participates in 1 workshop.

                            <br/>
                            Once the teacher has mastered these areas, he/she is then ready to participate and appreciate the Blended & Personalized Learning course and are in a

                            experience and implementing this methodology in their classrooms. These teachers will build on their knowledge and 
                            experiences to take the next steps in the successful implementation of BPL by focussing on areas that they were not yet 
                            able to address in year 1. 
                            <br/>
                            Coaching sessions will take place 5 times over the course of the year and enable teachers to walk away and implement a 
                            sound BPL classroom in future years.

                            Year 2 teachers will have the opportunity to mentor year 1 teachers. 
                            This can look different in each school, allowing for meetings between cohort 1 and cohort 2 teachers and or classroom observations, learning walks, etc. 
                            The coach will support the teacher in this role as he/she can now be a role model for the new cohort of teachers within the school.

                        <p>
                            This coaching is geared towards teachers who participated in any of  Lomdei’s courses. 
                            These teachers will build on their knowledge and experiences to take the next steps in the successful implementation of their practice 
                            by focusing on areas that they were not yet able to address in year 1.

                            <strong> 1:1 Coaching</strong> <br/>
                            10 sessions of 1:1 remote coaching between 30-40 min each

                            <strong> Leadership Role/ Mentoring</strong> <br/>
                            Year 2 teachers will have the opportunity to mentor year 1 teachers. 
                            This can look different in each school, allowing for meetings between cohort 1 and cohort 2 teachers and or classroom observations, learning walks, etc. 
                            The coach will support the teacher in this role as he/she can now be a role model for the new cohort of teachers within the school.
