                            implementing it in their classrooms.
                            These teachers will build on their knowledge and experience to take the next steps in the
                            successful implementation of BPL.

                            The course is typically taken by 2nd year Lomdei BPL teachers or by teachers who have been
                            trained in BPL in other venues and want to sharpen
                            their skills and impact in their classrooms.

                            This course trains a representative at your school to become a Lomdei BPL coach who will
                            coach other teachers at your school. The coach will get training in the Google
                            Challenge-Based Coaching
                            Model (the same model that all Lomdei coaches follow). Your in-house coach will learn all
                            the necessary methodologies to effectively coach teachers and oversee classroom
                            observations.

                        <p>
                            There are 2 reasons to consider having someone on your staff train to be a Lomdei BPL coach:

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Having someone “on the ground'' who can consistently check in with teachers and observe
                                their classes in person will advance the success of the teacher who is implementing the
                                Lomdei BPL Project.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Having an in-house coach will save on the school’s cost per teacher for the Lomdei BPL
                                program. We will no longer need to provide a coach for each teacher.
